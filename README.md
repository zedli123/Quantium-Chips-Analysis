# Quantium-Chips-Analysis
## 1. Business Objective
A leading supermarket partnered with Quantium to uncover **data-driven insights** to grow their **chips sales**. At the time, they lacked a clear understanding of customer purchasing behaviors, which made it challenging to design **targeted marketing campaigns** or test new store layouts effectively.  

This project bridges that gap by:  

- 🔍 **Analyzing purchase and transaction data** to uncover customer buying patterns.  
- 🏷️ **Segmenting customers with RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify high-value customer groups.  
- 🧪 **Designing an A/B testing plan** to select the best trial and control stores for a new store layout experiment.  

By turning raw data into actionable insights, this analysis helps the client **understand customers better, personalize marketing efforts, and boost sales and revenue in the chips category**.
